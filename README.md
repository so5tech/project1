# Multi-layer Model Classifier for Cyberattack detection in
Smart Electric Grid

In the Smart Grid, communication lines and phys- ical open access points are always prone to cyber-
attacks, and electric theft is the most common one. To detect electricity theft, researchers have
developed several advanced machine learning models. However, existing work has not explored
the problem of data imbalance properly, which is one of the significant challenges in electricity
consumption data. This Dissertation work aims to compare various data balancing techniques and
present an integrated theft detection model.
This Dissertation work presents a multi-layer model for detecting fraud- ulent consumers in the
smart grid. The detection process starts with data preparation steps, which include data interpola-
tion, outlier handling, and data standardization. The next crucial step is handling data imbalance.
Various techniques are tested, and AdaSys performs better than others. The model is being trained
on a balanced dataset and validated on a real imbalanced dataset for realistic results. For higher
performance, a two-layer model is chosen for electricity theft detection. The first layer consists
of three heterogeneous machine learning models, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model
is used for the second layer. The first layerâ€™s probabilistic prediction serves as input to the sec-
ond layer, which makes the final prediction. Experimental results confirm that multilayer model
classifiers perform better than individual classifiers for detecting cyber-attacks on real consumption
datasets.
